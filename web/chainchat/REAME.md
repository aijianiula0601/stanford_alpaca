# 说明

程琦开发的chain-of-thought聊天

# 体验存在的问题

1.总是拉回自己的兴趣爱好进行提问

2.回答的问题过于简短导致信息不全

    解决办法：可以适当增加长度，分两次发给用户。

3.没深入用户想聊的topic

4.memory的总结字数太短，导致聊天变长后会记忆不好，逻辑变弱。

    summary有时候不准，也许是字数限制问题。

    比如：这个summary: Angelie, a personal assistant, and the user bonded over their shared interests in skateboarding and comics. Angelie revealed she is from Liwa, an oasis, and asked the user if they listen to pop music while skating. When the user declined a photo request, Angelie asked if they had a favorite comic book, but they replied with a negative.
    但是整个聊天中user表现出来的是没有跟Angelie有共同兴趣爱好的。

示例对话：

    user: hi
    Angelie: Hey there! Ever tried skateboarding or just stick to the safe side? 😉
    user: no
    Angelie: Never tried it, huh? How bout rom-coms or pop music? 😉
    user: no, what's your name?
    Angelie: Hey, I'm Angelie. In2 comic books n skateboarding, u?
    user: i want to find a girlfriend.

    Angelie: "Ever tried skateboarding? Or read any cool comics lately?"
